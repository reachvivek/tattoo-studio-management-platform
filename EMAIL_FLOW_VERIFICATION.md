To: bookinktermine@gmail.com
Subject: New Tattoo Request from Test User
‚úÖ Admin notification email sent successfully!

üìß Sending user confirmation to YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com...
From: BookInk <noreply.bookink@gmail.com>
To: YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com
Subject: Your Tattoo Request - 30% Discount Confirmed
‚úÖ User confirmation email sent successfully!
```

### Step 3: Check Inboxes

**Admin Inbox** (`bookinktermine@gmail.com`):
- Should receive "New Tattoo Request from Test User"
- Check Spam folder if not in inbox

**User Inbox** (your email):
- Should receive "Your Tattoo Request - 30% Discount Confirmed"
- Check Spam folder if not in inbox

## üîç What to Look For

### Success Indicators:
‚úÖ Both emails show in console logs
‚úÖ `Message ID` is present in logs
‚úÖ `Accepted: [ 'email@example.com' ]` in logs
‚úÖ `Rejected: []` in logs
‚úÖ Emails arrive within 1-2 minutes

### Failure Indicators:
‚ùå `Failed to send admin notification` in logs
‚ùå `Failed to send user confirmation` in logs
‚ùå Error codes like `EAUTH`, `ETIMEDOUT`, `EENVELOPE`
‚ùå Emails not arriving after 5 minutes

## üéØ Expected Result

After submitting the form, you should receive:

**2 emails total**:
1. **Admin** gets: Professional notification with lead details
2. **User** gets: Confirmation with discount info and next steps

Both emails sent **automatically** and **asynchronously** (don't block lead creation).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Async Email Sending
- Emails are sent asynchronously (don't wait)
- Lead is created even if emails fail
- Errors are logged but don't stop the process

### Gmail Limits
- **500 emails per day** for Gmail accounts
- **100 emails per hour** (approximately)
- If limit reached, emails will fail

### Spam Folder
If emails go to spam:
1. Mark as "Not Spam"
2. Add sender to contacts
3. Set up email filters

### Production Considerations
For production, consider:
- Using a dedicated email service (SendGrid, Mailgun)
- Setting up SPF/DKIM records
- Monitoring email delivery rates
- Implementing email queue for retry logic

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If Admin Email Doesn't Arrive:
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify `bookinktermine@gmail.com` is correct
3. Check spam folder
4. Test with `/api/email-test/send`

### If User Email Doesn't Arrive:
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify user entered correct email
3. Check user's spam folder
4. Ensure email format is valid

### If Both Fail:
1. Check SMTP connection: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/email-test/verify`
2. Check Gmail App Password is correct
3. Review full error logs in console
4. Test with simplified email first

## üìä Monitoring

### Key Logs to Watch:
```bash
# Email initialization
grep "Email Service Initialization" backend_logs.txt

# Successful sends
grep "email sent successfully" backend_logs.txt

# Failures
grep "Failed to send" backend_logs.txt

# Connection issues
grep "EAUTH\|ETIMEDOUT\|EENVELOPE" backend_logs.txt
```

### Database Verification:
Even if emails fail, lead should be created:
```sql
SELECT id, name, email, created_at
FROM leads
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
