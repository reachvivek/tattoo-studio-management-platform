# Email Template Changes - Spam Filter Optimization

## Problem
The original fancy HTML email templates with:
- Bold colors (#dc2626 red everywhere)
- "EXCLUSIVE DISCOUNT" in large text
- Marketing-heavy language
- Complex styling and badges

Were being flagged as spam by Gmail's filters.

## Solution
Simplified to professional, business-like email templates with:
- Simple black and white design
- Minimal inline CSS
- Professional business language
- Clean, readable layout
